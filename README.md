# Jahnvi Bhateja – Data Analyst Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Jahnvi Bhateja! I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Economics from IGNOU and preparing for the RBI Grade B – DEPR exam (2026). I have also completed certification courses in Power BI, Excel, and Python from CloudyML. My journey into data analysis is driven by a strong interest in economic data, public policy, and business decision-making.

I am passionate about using data to generate actionable insights, and I'm continually building my skills in data visualization, data cleaning, and statistical analysis. With a blend of economics and data science, I am eager to contribute as an entry-level data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy creating dashboards, writing reports, and exploring real-world datasets to uncover meaningful trends.

My CV is available in [pdf](link-to-your-cv).
